    <h3>Portfolio</h3>
    <p>well for one I got this website right here, so thats some of my portfolio lol</p>

    <!---
        okay so heres my plan, I'd like a closeup of a promena in the bottom
        right of the screen, that'll turn and zoom depending on where on the page
        you are, so this bit wants to be a single-page-application. 
        need to make a 3d model of promena.
